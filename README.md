# emo-association-task

The Emotion Association Task is a property association task designed to examine the nature of emotion concept associations across the lifespan. This task was adapted from MacCormack et al. (2021) by Adrienne S. Bonar (adrienne.bonar@unc.edu) with help from Mallory J. Feldman (mjfeld@unc.edu). It consist of a block of 4 practice trials and 144 test trials.

During each trial of the task, subjects are asked to rate how related one of six emotion words is to an interoceptive, behavioral, or situational word on a scale ranging from 1 (Not at All) to 5 (Extermely); participants are instructed to make their rating as "quickly" and as "accurately" as possible, though the rating trials are self-paced. The rating trials are followed by a 500 ms intertrial interval.
